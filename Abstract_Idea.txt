Our Project: Decentralised NGO Funding

Our Project is designed to develop and promote charity through cryptocurrencies crowdfunding. 

Reason of project:


1)	There is need to rebuild trust so that people can safely donate to charity and can validate that their money is used for what it’s meant for. [Money donated is used judiciously]
2)	Many of these Non-Profit Organisations don’t have access to many donors, and are not very skilled in marketing their campaigns. This Project is giving them a chance to receive funding from global donors.
Blockchain donations are easy, global, quick.

We have currently considered, only 1 donor. That is NGO is able to send funds to third party from one donor only.

Future scope: NGO will be able to fund a project from many donors and lots of other functionalities that we were not able to implement 
in this short span of time, as this being our first solidity project.
